## We take the encoded image (dxH/32xW/32) and send it to Multi-Head Attention (FROM WHERE DO WE TAKE THIS ENCODED IMAGE?)

## We do something here to generate NxMxH/32xW/32 maps. (WHAT DO WE DO HERE?)

## Then we concatenate these maps with Res5 Block (WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?)

## Then we perform the above steps (EXPLAIN THESE STEPS)
